              Hi, my name is Mohit. I am a REACT developer who loves to create
              and design amazing web apps for users who value creativity and
              ease of use.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest in web development began back in 6th standard when I
              found out that anyone can make a website of their own. Till then I
              was under the impression that only big organizations got their own
              websites like a badge for being big and important.
            </p>
            <p>
              But now I knew. This new knowledge that was embarked on me made me
              dive deep into the fascinating world of web dev where everything
              was a new discovery for me.
            </p>
            <p>It's been years now but the exploration still continues.</p>
